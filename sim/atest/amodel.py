"""Check the sound test (atest.asm; spec 13) against a model of spec 13 and
retro-hw's audio_engine spec, section 4.6. retro68k's sim/atest/amodel.py
(hw-audio, d706cd2), with the SRAM little-endian and the beeper in the DAC.

    amodel.py DIR RAM.hex

Reads DIR/audio.txt (one line per output sample, from the testbench with
+audio: left, right, the number of 1s each DAC stream gave during the
sample before, the channels started and the channels played) and works
out every output sample from the same channel set-ups and sample data.
They must match exactly. The DAC streams must follow the output with the
beeper's -BEEPAMP added (its bit is 0 throughout): averaged over 16
samples, within 1%.
